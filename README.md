The MemoryTool is a C++ tool that provides functionality for reading and writing memory in a target process. It allows you to search for specific values in memory, modify memory addresses, freeze and unfreeze memory values, and perform various system-related operations. This documentation provides an overview of the tool's functionality, along with code snippets to demonstrate how to use each feature.

# Introduction
I don't know who initially wrote this memory tool. I have put in a lot of effort to correct non-working functions, fix errors, optimize the code, add proper documentation, and implement proper object-oriented programming structures to ensure the smooth running of the script. I have also added new functions.

Please note that this tool only works for rooted devices as the non-rooted (virtual environment) functionality has not been implemented yet.

If you encounter any non-working functions, please open an issue and report it.

# Samples
``main.cpp`` is the sample file to run the MemoryTool
### main.cpp File Explanation
The sample code provided demonstrates the usage of the memory tool. Let's go through it step by step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "MemoryTools.h"

int main(int arc, char argv[]) {
	/* 1. Package Name of the game
	2. ROOT_MODE (tells you are using rooted device (not reooted device not implimented yet))
	*/
	char game_package[] = "com.tencent.ig";
	MemoryTool memory_tool;
	memory_tool.initXMemoryTools(game_package, MODE_ROOT);
```

The code includes necessary headers and initializes the memory tool by calling initXMemoryTools(). It takes two parameters: the process name (in this case, "com.tencent.ig") and the mode ("MODE_ROOT" for rooted devices).

```cpp
   memory_tool.SetSearchRange(ALL);
```
The SetSearchRange() function sets the search range for memory operations. In this case, it is set to "ALL," which means searching in all memory ranges.

```cpp
   memory_tool.MemorySearch("1", TYPE_BYTE);
```
The MemorySearch() function is used to search for a specific value in memory. In this example, it searches for the value "1" of type TYPE_BYTE.

```cpp
    memory_tool.MemoryOffset("2", 2, /*offset*/ TYPE_BYTE);
```
The MemoryOffset() function is used to search for a specific value at an offset from a base address. It searches for the value "2" of type TYPE_BYTE with an offset of 2.

```cpp
    memory_tool.MemoryWrite("0", 2, /*offset*/ TYPE_BYTE);
```
The MemoryWrite() function is used to write a value to a specific memory address. In this example, it writes the value "0" of type TYPE_BYTE with an offset of 2.

```cpp
    memory_tool.ClearResults();
```
The ClearResults() function clears the linked list of results and frees up memory.
```cpp
    return 0;
}
```
The program ends and returns 0.

## 1. Data Structures
The MemoryTool tool uses the following data structures:

    struct RESULT *next;
};
```

* addr: The memory address.
* next: Pointer to the next RESULT structure.

### FREEZE
```cpp
struct FREEZE {
    long int addr; // address
    char *value; // value
    int type; // type
    struct FREEZE *next; // pointer to the next node
};
```

* addr: The memory address.
* value: The value at the memory address.
* type: The type of memory.
* next: Pointer to the next FREEZE structure.

## 2. Initialization
To use the MemoryTool, you need to create an instance of the MemoryTool class. Here's how to initialize the tool:
